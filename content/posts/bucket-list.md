### It’s almost confirmed… 

I am most likely graduating a quarter early. So that means a *Solo Backpacking Europe Trip*!!!!!

Thanks dad for the vote of confidence. Just need to get my mother onboard now 🥳

With all this potential time before getting a job, I wanted to curate a list of the places I’d like to visit, and some crazy bucket list items I could try. 

I will continue to edit this post. Adding and checking off items, and hopefully making separate posts for some of them. 

### First up, destinations 

- [ ] Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹 
- [ ] Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹 
- [ ] Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸 
- [ ] Nice, France 🇫🇷 
- [ ] Rome, Italy 🇮🇹 
- [ ] Bologna, Italy 🇮🇹 
- [ ] Prague, Czech Republic 🇨🇿 
- [ ] Budapest, Hungary 🇭🇺 
- [ ] Athens, Greece 🇬🇷 
- [ ] Delphi, Greece 🇬🇷 
- [ ] Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 

Hm. Not sure if I’ll have time for all of this, but hopefully 1.5 months will cut it. 

### Tbh stuff I can do right now (SD edition)

- [ ] A full beach day - dinner included
- [ ] Ho chi minh trail
- [ ] An’s dry cleaning (can’t believe I haven’t been yet 😐)
- [ ] Zoo 🐼 
- [ ] Cave store, even if it’s overrated
- [ ] Picnic at Kate Sessions


### Funky, miscellaneous, and also with no timeline

- [ ] Learn how to handstand
- [ ] Become an extra in a show/movie 
- [ ] Make a clarified cocktail 
- [ ] Watch Evil Bong on Amazon Prime with Nidhi 
- [ ] Host/Attend an anything but a cup party
- [ ] Visit the sand dunes near SD
- [ ] Dine at a Michelin star restaurant

Oops, originally I was going to make some crazy bucket list items specifically for Spring and Summer 2026 (when I will be utterly jobless). But I don't see why majority of these items need to follow that timeline! Other than the destinations, of course. 

I will keep y'all updated.
