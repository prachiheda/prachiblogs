So Weston Estate finally dropped GO! which they have literally been playing at their concerts as an "unreleased" song for the last two years. 

I can tell it will already be one of my favorite songs on their new album superbloom. Seems like they took inspiration from carnatic music, with a bit of sitar at the end. 

Their guitarist posted a fire electric guitar solo over the chorus, AND I KNEW I HAD TO LEARN IT. So I took a screen recording of the story, slowed it down, and analyzed each chord in the blurry ass video. 

Please enjoy these tabs I have put together at 1 am. 

Capo: 3rd fret. Around 120 bpm.
