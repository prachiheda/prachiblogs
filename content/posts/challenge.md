### Who, what, when, where, why?  

Hi there. If you are reading this, thank you for joining me! It really means a lot. 

I am finally starting this blog, once and for all. And I would love to share a little bit about why I am doing this. 

## First off, Who?

If you don't know me, my name is Prachi and I am a few things: 

- First and foremost, a student at UCSD
- A thrifting queen
- Wannabe software engineer
- A bit of a clean freak üò≠
- Obsessed with snap peas idk
- Huge ATLA fan
- Just a girly lol

And maybe some other things I guess. 

## Whats the plan?

I really want to start writing more! I like to journal (mostly when I am crashing out though...), so I thought it could be fun to write about other things and share it with my friends. 

For the most part, I plan to write about some of my CS projects, maybe a tutorial here and there, opinions, places I enjoyed, heck what about a recipe. I can drop my classic sesame garlic tofu recipe, which I literally have memorized. 

## But when? 

I'll try to write something every week. I have my handy dandy Atoms app to remind me, so I'll try my best oops. 

## Where? 

Um, wherever I am ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Most likely California, whether that's in San Diego or the Bay. But wouldn't it be cool if I was writing in Europe?? Backpacking trip soon, I swear. 

## But really, why?

Lowkey had a mid-life crisis. Just kidding I think. But I want to have a little outlet to share things I find interesting, projects I am working on, and improve my writing skills. The goal is to look back at old posts and go "Woah, I really wrote that. Thats kinda cool."

It's also to get out of my comfort zone. Sometimes, I feel hesitant to write so publicly, where people I know can find and read these posts. But who really cares, right? This blog is for me, and me only! And for my friends and fam, my biggest supporters. 

So cheers!
