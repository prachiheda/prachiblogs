And also a big inspiration to millions. He is a tech genius (he literally started Y Combinator), a phenomenal writer, and a studied painter. What can’t this man do?!\nI can see myself taking some inspiration from his blog, which is like digital time capsule from the Y2K era — minimalist, unapologetic, and kind of iconic. RAQs? What a rebellion against FAQs, of course Paul Graham would answer the questions no one else thinks to ask. (Rarely Asked Questions, if you were confused).\nCities and Ambition Cities and Ambition, written in 2008, highlights how various cities prioritize types of ambition. At a high level, here are some pairings that are discussed:\nNew York -\u003e Make more money Cambridge -\u003e Be smarter Silicon Valley -\u003e Gain power Florence circa 1500s -\u003e Be Leonardo da Vinci Arguably, the message that a city sends means a world of difference in how you live you life. For that reason, people who prioritize a certain type of ambition flock to the same cities, even if the weather is dismal and it is way too expensive - just think Cambridge.\nAn interesting point Paul claimed is that ambitions are incompatible - and therefore each city only focuses on one type of ambition. After trying to find a counterexample, I think this is true (in my experience. Of course I have lived in very few cities yet). When I think of LA, I imagine fame. In SF, highly technical companies are the name of the game. Living San Diego, relaxation and slow days are what everyone desires. Is that even considered an “ambition”? Only people in San Diego would know…LOL\nHow its changed Funny enough, Graham said that San Francisco’s message “seems to be the same as Berkeley’s: you should live better. But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley.” He is basically saying that SF was a crunchy alternative to the Valley. And, apparently, creating a startup in SF was considered a “self-indulgent choice,” which is still true - SF is darn expensive. But, I think that the shift already happened in the past 5 years - even YC, his own startup incubator, quietly moved its HQ to SF in 2023. So don’t worry Paul Graham, your dream of startup asceticism1 lives on, it’s just sipping 8$ cold brew in SoMa.\nWhich is funny, because now the narrative seems to be flipping again.\nI feel there’s been a recent trend of saying “SF is not it anymore.”\nAnd yeah, I get it — between the homelessness, car break-ins, and some sketchy late-night vibes, it’s easy to write off the city as broken. But its not dead. It’s just evolving in weird, chaotic, very SF ways.\nFor example, Hacker houses are creating LinkedIn microcultures of builders again. An echo of early Silicon Valley, but with less khaki shorts, more AI agents. There’s a real “build weird stuff, find your tribe” energy going on.\nSo maybe the cities message isn’t “live better” but more so “live on the edge… of a new product launch.”\nTaking a step back from San Francisco, the entire idea of ambition has seemed to change. I don’t think ambition is just intellectual or money-driven anymore. It’s about your vibe, visibility, and whether your life looks good in a photo dump. You could raise goats OR funds, and still be seen as ambitious—just in a different way.\nWondering where SD fits into this While obviously Paul did not live in San Diego, I do. And I wonder what message this city is trying to send.\nFrom an academia and corporate world perspective, I think SD is highly underrated - simply because no one talks about what is going on. But UCSD and the biotech industry (which literally surrounds my house) is huge, but theres not much flash. So maybe the message is “Do important work, but don’t make a scene about it”?\nSD has also has strong creative community — indie bands like Thee Sacred Souls, and designers such as Don Norman, father of design and founder of the Design Lab (showing off a bit here). Here, people quietly put out beautiful work without chasing headlines. So what about “You should create for joy, not for clout?\"\nUnlike the cities Graham mentioned, SD is absolutely sprawling. So it is possible that the physical distance between communities dilutes our message, or creates dozens at once.\nIn a way, the message becomes more personal. Like the favorite book we throw in our tote bag on the way to La Jolla Shores, or the quiet joy of reliving a weekend from freshman year with the same friends, just a little older now.\nAsceticism = a lifestyle characterized by self-discipline and avoidance of indulgence. In Grahams eyes, cup-noodle fueled coding marathons, not matcha on tap. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"812","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-04-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-04-07T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Prachi Heda"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/cities-ambition/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Prachi Blogs.","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://prachiblogs.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://prachiblogs.com/ accesskey=h title="Prachi Blogs.
