[{"content":"Who, what, when, where, why? Hi there. If you are reading this, thank you for joining me! It really means a lot.\nI am finally starting this blog, once and for all. And I would love to share a little bit about why I am doing this.\nFirst off, Who? If you don\u0026rsquo;t know me, my name is Prachi and I am a few things:\nFirst and foremost, a student at UCSD A thrifting queen Wannabe software engineer A bit of a clean freak üò≠ Obsessed with snap peas idk Huge ATLA fan Just a girly lol And maybe some other things I guess.\nWhats the plan? I really want to start writing more! I like to journal (mostly when I am crashing out though\u0026hellip;), so I thought it could be fun to write about other things and share it with my friends.\nFor the most part, I plan to write about some of my CS projects, maybe a tutorial here and there, opinions, places I enjoyed, heck what about a recipe. I can drop my classic sesame garlic tofu recipe, which I literally have memorized.\nBut when? I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write something every week. I have my handy dandy Atoms app to remind me, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best oops.\nWhere? Um, wherever I am ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nMost likely California, whether that\u0026rsquo;s in San Diego or the Bay. But wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be cool if I was writing in Europe?? Backpacking trip soon, I swear.\nBut really, why? Lowkey had a mid-life crisis. Just kidding I think. But I want to have a little outlet to share things I find interesting, projects I am working on, and improve my writing skills. The goal is to look back at old posts and go \u0026ldquo;Woah, I really wrote that. Thats kinda cool.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also to get out of my comfort zone. Sometimes, I feel hesitant to write so publicly, where people I know can find and read these posts. But who really cares, right? This blog is for me, and me only! And for my friends and fam, my biggest supporters.\nSo cheers!\n","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/challenge/","summary":"A peek into why I started this blog.","title":"The five W's"}]
