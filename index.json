[{"content":"Before We Get Into It! GUYS! I am writing this blog post from bed!! You might be wondering, how else would I be writing this?! By creating a markdown file in vscode and pushing to github 😵‍💫 I know, pretty awful and way too much work for just a blog post.\nBut I automated all that boring stuff by making my own personal app that allows me to write and edit posts and push them to my site directly! I cannot wait to add more features like deleting posts, updating the UI, and adding images 🥹 I will also dedicate my next post on how I made the app!\nI am so happy because now I can write more shitposts as well lol.\nOkay cool moving on.\nJunior Year Is Almost Over. I feel like I am in a dream, and life is not real. Honestly, this quarter had a few highs and slightly more lows, with crazy classes and mental wellness.\nI don’t want to sound pessimist but as each year of college goes on, life becomes exponentially more serious. I know people who are moving onto the next big chapter of their life, such as pursuing grad school, moving to a new city, or working full time.\nI feel so much uncertainty in my future, let alone where I am right now. Maybe you can relate. I know I need to stop being so serious but sometimes it feels like everyone else has it figured out! Of course it seems that way from an outsider perspective, but we must remember that everyone has their own hardships too. Hah I need to follow my own advice.\nREPEAT AFTER ME!!!\nComparison is the thief of joy I do NOT have to have “everything figured out” I don’t need to rush—my path is uniquely mine Every small action I take is proof that I’m showing up for myself So many more i could keep going forever… (Guys I’m at the point where I need these affirmations as a ringtone, a bumper sticker, a baby tee, and printed on a bottle of vodka labeled “You’re Fine, Probably” 😭)\nOkay jokes aside, l want to dissect the happies and sads of this quarter as a small reflection of where I am at right now.\nHappies started off weekend 1 strong with hella kickbacks and beach day with everyone insane turnout for HealthLink career fair pickle ball and tennis classes so so many HealthLink events and lots of learning how to troubleshoot TAP forms 😅 balboa Earth Fest with gal pals, crazy thrift finds celebrating Yazmin’s birthday! UCLAAAAA + exploring LA with the best team ever sungod. tbh enjoyed dressing up more than anything second place at groq hack day. Idk what i’m gonna do with so much groq merch. first welfare wednesday 😳 wild experience. playing the guitar everyday! I can see so much improvement 🥹 Sads haven’t been going to the gym much ☹️ mandatory classes plus living off campus has made this so difficult time consuming classes. tell me why i have individual labs, group assignments, group projects, quizzes, two midterms, final project presentations, weekly meetings just for one class. lots of anxiety. what does it mean to be successful, and how to achieve so called success anxiety. always feeling that I am not doing enough, but also finding it hard to do more more anxiety. being hyper self aware about my anxiety makes me wonder why I am not able to make it go away maybe some more sad thoughts that I don’t want to put out in the public lol. I am very lucky that a lot of my “sads” are not caused by external factors. But it’s a double-edged sword—because that means it’s all in me. I guess I’m in control of my life… but that also means I can’t blame anything else when I feel stuck, unmotivated, or lost.\nTo anyone that made it this far, I appreciate you for reading some of my sadder thoughts. If you are also feeling overwhelmed or unsure, I see you. But I think we will be okay together!\n","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/week_7_thoughts-/","summary":"Some thoughts I’ve been having.","title":"Week 7 Thoughts"},{"content":"Heading Example testing app Some bold text, some italic text.\nList item 1 List item 2 ","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/new-post/","summary":"YOUR SUMMARY HERE","title":"testing"},{"content":"Paul Graham Paul Graham is someone I would call an enigma. And also a big inspiration to millions. He is a tech genius (he literally started Y Combinator), a phenomenal writer, and a studied painter. What can’t this man do?!\nI can see myself taking some inspiration from his blog, which is like a digital time capsule from the Y2K era — minimalist, unapologetic, and kind of iconic. RAQs? What a rebellion against FAQs. Of course Paul Graham would answer the questions no one else thinks to ask. (Rarely Asked Questions, if you were confused).\nCities and Ambition Cities and Ambition, written in 2008, highlights how various cities prioritize types of ambition. He explores the idea that cities send subtle messages about what you should care about. Those messages, whether through overheard conversations or embedded in daily life, shape what people strive for. At a high level, here are some pairings that are discussed:\nNew York -\u0026gt; Make more money. Cambridge -\u0026gt; Be smarter. Silicon Valley -\u0026gt; Gain power. Florence circa 1500s -\u0026gt; Be Leonardo da Vinci. Arguably, the message that a city sends means a world of difference in how you live your life. For that reason, people who prioritize a certain type of ambition flock to the same cities, even if the weather is dismal and it is way too expensive—just think Cambridge.\nAn interesting point Paul claimed is that ambitions are incompatible—and therefore each city only focuses on one type of ambition. After trying to find a counterexample, I think this is true (in my experience, but of course I have lived in very few cities yet). When I think of LA, I imagine fame. In SF, highly technical companies are the name of the game. Living in San Diego, relaxation and slow days are what everyone desires. Is that even considered an “ambition”? Only people in San Diego would know… LOL\nFavorite excerpts \u0026ldquo;A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see through windows, in conversations you overhear. It\u0026rsquo;s not something you have to seek out, but something you can\u0026rsquo;t turn off.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Some people know at 16 what sort of work they\u0026rsquo;re going to do, but in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific to be ambitious about.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city? No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t the only places that do. For some kinds of work, all you need is a handful of talented colleagues.\u0026rdquo;\n– Paul Graham, Cities and Ambition\nHow its changed Funny enough, Graham said that San Francisco’s message “seems to be the same as Berkeley’s: you should live better. But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley.” He is basically saying that SF was a crunchy alternative to the Valley. And, apparently, creating a startup in SF was considered a “self-indulgent choice,” which is still true—SF is darn expensive. But I think that the shift already happened in the past 5 years—even YC, his own startup incubator, quietly moved its HQ to SF in 2023. So don’t worry Paul Graham, your dream of startup asceticism1 lives on, it’s just sipping $8 cold brew in SoMa.\nWhich is funny, because now the narrative seems to be flipping again.\nI feel there’s been a recent trend of saying, “SF is not it anymore.”\nAnd yeah, I get it — between the homelessness, car break-ins, and some sketchy late-night vibes, it’s easy to write off the city as broken. But it\u0026rsquo;s not dead. It’s just evolving in weird, chaotic, very SF ways.\nFor example, Hacker houses are creating LinkedIn microcultures of builders again. An echo of early Silicon Valley, but with less khaki shorts, more AI agents. There’s a real “build weird stuff, find your tribe” energy going on.\nSo maybe the city\u0026rsquo;s message isn’t “live better” but more so “live on the edge… of a new product launch.”\nTaking a step back from San Francisco, the entire idea of ambition has seemed to change. I don’t think ambition is just intellectual or money-driven anymore. It’s about your vibe, visibility, and whether your life looks good in a photo dump. You could raise goats OR funds and still be seen as ambitious—just in a different way.\nWondering where SD fits into this While obviously Paul did not live in San Diego, I do. And I wonder what message this city is trying to send.\nFrom an academia and corporate world perspective, I think SD is highly underrated—simply because no one talks about what is going on. But UCSD and the biotech industry (which literally surrounds my house) are huge, but there\u0026rsquo;s not much flash. So maybe the message is “Do important work, but don’t make a scene about it”?\nSD also has a strong creative community — indie bands like Thee Sacred Souls and designers such as Don Norman, father of design and founder of the Design Lab (showing off a bit here). Here, people quietly put out beautiful work without chasing headlines. So what about “You should create for joy, not for clout?\u0026quot;\nUnlike the cities Graham mentioned, SD is absolutely sprawling. So it is possible that the physical distance between communities dilutes our message or creates dozens at once.\nIn a way, the message becomes more personal. Like the favorite book we throw in our tote bag on the way to La Jolla Shores, or the quiet joy of reliving a weekend from freshman year with the same friends, just a little older now.\nAsceticism = a lifestyle characterized by self-discipline and avoidance of indulgence. In Grahams eyes, cup-noodle fueled coding marathons, not matcha on tap.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/cities-ambition/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"paul-graham\"\u003ePaul Graham\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Graham is someone I would call an enigma.

Just need to get my mother onboard now 🥳\nEdit: She said yes.\nWith all this potential time before getting a job, I wanted to curate a list of the places I’d like to visit, and some crazy bucket list items I could try.\nI will continue to edit this post. Adding and checking off items, and hopefully making separate posts for some of them.\nFirst up, destinations Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹 Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹 Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸 Nice, France 🇫🇷 Rome, Italy 🇮🇹 Bologna, Italy 🇮🇹 Prague, Czech Republic 🇨🇿 Budapest, Hungary 🇭🇺 Athens, Greece 🇬🇷 Delphi, Greece 🇬🇷 Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Hm.

Hi there. If you are reading this, thank you for joining me! It really means a lot.\nI am finally starting this blog, once and for all. And I would love to share a little bit about why I am doing this.\nFirst off, Who? If you don\u0026rsquo;t know me, my name is Prachi and I am a few things:\nFirst and foremost, a student at UCSD A thrifting queen Wannabe software engineer A bit of a clean freak 😭 Obsessed with snap peas idk Huge ATLA fan Just a girly lol And maybe some other things I guess.\nWhats the plan? I really want to start writing more! I like to journal (mostly when I am crashing out though\u0026hellip;), so I thought it could be fun to write about other things and share it with my friends.\nFor the most part, I plan to write about some of my CS projects, maybe a tutorial here and there, opinions, places I enjoyed, heck what about a recipe. I can drop my classic sesame garlic tofu recipe, which I literally have memorized.\nBut when? I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write something every week. I have my handy dandy Atoms app to remind me, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best oops.\nWhere? Um, wherever I am 🤷‍♀️\nMost likely California, whether that\u0026rsquo;s in San Diego or the Bay. But wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be cool if I was writing in Europe?? Backpacking trip soon, I swear.\nBut really, why? Lowkey had a mid-life crisis. Just kidding I think. But I want to have a little outlet to share things I find interesting, projects I am working on, and improve my writing skills. The goal is to look back at old posts and go \u0026ldquo;Woah, I really wrote that. Thats kinda cool.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also to get out of my comfort zone. Sometimes, I feel hesitant to write so publicly, where people I know can find and read these posts. But who really cares, right? This blog is for me, and me only! And for my friends and fam, my biggest supporters.\nSo cheers!\n","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/challenge/","summary":"A peek into why I started this blog.","title":"The five W's"}]
