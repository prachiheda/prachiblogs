[{"content":"okay trying this again…. ","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/new-post3/","summary":"YOUR SUMMARY HERE","title":"YOUR TITLE HERE"},{"content":"Who, what, when, where, why? Hi there. If you are reading this, thank you for joining me! It really means a lot.\nI am finally starting this blog, once and for all. And I would love to share a little bit about why I am doing this.\nFirst off, Who? If you don\u0026rsquo;t know me, my name is Prachi and I am a few things:\nFirst and foremost, a student at UCSD A thrifting queen Wannabe software engineer A bit of a clean freak 😭 Obsessed with snap peas idk Huge ATLA fan Just a girly lol And maybe some other things I guess.\nWhats the plan? I really want to start writing more! I like to journal (mostly when I am crashing out though\u0026hellip;), so I thought it could be fun to write about other things and share it with my friends.\nFor the most part, I plan to write about some of my CS projects, maybe a tutorial here and there, opinions, places I enjoyed, heck what about a recipe. I can drop my classic sesame garlic tofu recipe, which I literally have memorized.\nBut when? I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write something every week. I have my handy dandy Atoms app to remind me, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best oops.\nWhere? Um, wherever I am 🤷‍♀️\nMost likely California, whether that\u0026rsquo;s in San Diego or the Bay. But wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be cool if I was writing in Europe?? Backpacking trip soon, I swear.\nBut really, why? Lowkey had a mid-life crisis. Just kidding I think. But I want to have a little outlet to share things I find interesting, projects I am working on, and improve my writing skills. The goal is to look back at old posts and go \u0026ldquo;Woah, I really wrote that. Thats kinda cool.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also to get out of my comfort zone. Sometimes, I feel hesitant to write so publicly, where people I know can find and read these posts. But who really cares, right? This blog is for me, and me only! And for my friends and fam, my biggest supporters.\nSo cheers!\n","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/challenge/","summary":"A peek into why I started this blog.","title":"The five W's"},{"content":"It’s almost confirmed… I am most likely graduating a quarter early. So that means a Solo Backpacking Europe Trip!!!!!\nThanks dad for the vote of confidence. Just need to get my mother onboard now 🥳\nWith all this potential time before getting a job, I wanted to curate a list of the places I’d like to visit, and some crazy bucket list items I could try.\nI will continue to edit this post. Adding and checking off items, and hopefully making separate posts for some of them.\nFirst up, destinations Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹 Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹 Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸 Nice, France 🇫🇷 Rome, Italy 🇮🇹 Bologna, Italy 🇮🇹 Prague, Czech Republic 🇨🇿 Budapest, Hungary 🇭🇺 Athens, Greece 🇬🇷 Delphi, Greece 🇬🇷 Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Hm. Not sure if I’ll have time for all of this, but hopefully 1.5 months will cut it.\nTbh stuff I can do right now (SD edition) A full beach day - dinner included Ho chi minh trail An’s dry cleaning (can’t believe I haven’t been yet 😐) Zoo 🐼 Cave store, even if it’s overrated Picnic at Kate Sessions Funky, miscellaneous, and also with no timeline Learn how to handstand Become an extra in a show/movie Make a clarified cocktail Watch Evil Bong on Amazon Prime with Nidhi Host/Attend an anything but a cup party Visit the sand dunes near SD Dine at a Michelin star restaurant Oops, originally I was going to make some crazy bucket list items specifically for Spring and Summer 2026 (when I will be utterly jobless). But I don\u0026rsquo;t see why majority of these items need to follow that timeline! Other than the destinations, of course.\nI will keep y\u0026rsquo;all updated.\n","permalink":"http://prachiblogs.com/posts/bucket-list/","summary":"BUCKET LISTS!!!","title":"Spring n Summer 2026"},{"content":"this is a test post!
